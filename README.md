# project1

Should be all done now, included a side project
called Cryptr, basically a far more complex
cypher program which can be installed as a
system application, the main assessment is only
guaranteed to work on linux and Cryptr definately
only works on linux. Not making Cryptr open
source, however if you want the source for it
to look over privately, email me at my student
email.

P.S. I had way more commits on here, but alot
of them were manual uploads to the github site,
unfortunately once I decided to do a proper
commit for my final, it errored out and stupid
me decided -f was the solution. Reset all my
commits back to the last "proper" commit I did
which was my first content one...
